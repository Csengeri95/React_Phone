# React App

This is a React website. By selecting from the phones listed on the Products page, you can click the Submit button on the Calculate page to get the value of your phone back. Using Axios, I send the form to a link provided and then display the returned value to the user. If he wishes, he can convert the received value to the currency of his choice.
